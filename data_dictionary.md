Data Dictionary

The following table contains the names of all items for which data were
extracted, along with a short description. Items are grouped according
to the step of cluster analysis.

Some items take values yes/no, e.g. ‘Was the study identified in the
PubMed search?’

  - yes = it was identified
  - no = it was not identified

Some items take values yes/no/NA, e.g. ‘Were smokers excluded?’

  - yes = the article states that smokers were excluded
  - no = the article states that smokers were not excluded
  - NA = the article does not mention whether smokers were excluded

Some items take the values yes/NA, e.g. ‘Complete case analysis’

  - yes = the article states that a complete case analysis was carried
    out
  - NA = the article does not mention a complete case analysis (but we
    cannot categorically say that it was not as this may just be poor
    reporting)
